	[MINUTE] [HOUR] [DOM] [MONTH] [DOW]<br/><br/>
	
	H not to be confused with hours is used to derive a hash from a project name.<br/>
	The hash is used to create a unique and but consistant time signature. This <br/>
	ensures jobs do not execute at the same exact time.<br/>
	  
	
	examples:<br/>
	# every fifteen minutes (perhaps at :07, :22, :37, :52)<br/>
	H/15 * * * *
	<br/><br/>
	# every ten minutes in the first half of every hour (three times, perhaps at :04, :14, :24)<br/>
	H(0-29)/10 * * * *
	<br/><br/>
	# once every two hours every weekday (perhaps at 10:38 AM, 12:38 PM, 2:38 PM, 4:38 PM)<br/>
	H 9-16/2 * * 1-5
	<br/><br/>
	# once a day on the 1st and 15th of every month except December<br/>
	H H 1,15 1-11 *
